Stage 2: Smart Contract for Messaging Metadata
Goal: Deploy a basic smart contract to store message references and sender/receiver data.

What to Build:

✅ Solidity contract with sendMessage(to, cid, timestamp) function
✅ Function to retrieve messages (e.g., getMessages(address))
Tech:

Solidity (Remix or Foundry)
Ganache or testnet (Polygon Mumbai, etc.)
Tests:

 Can I send a message entry (with CID) on-chain?
 Can I retrieve messages for a user?
✅ Stage 3: Message Encryption + IPFS Upload System
Goal: Encrypt messages and store them off-chain securely.

What to Build:

✅ Encryption service (using PointyCastle or OpenPGP)
✅ IPFS upload using web3.storage API
✅ Return CID from IPFS
Tech:

http package, pointycastle, web3.storage
Tests:

 Can I encrypt a message using a public key?
 Can I upload to IPFS and get a CID?
 Can I download & decrypt with private key?
✅ Stage 4: Chain + Off-chain Messaging Integration
Goal: Fully send messages from the app.

What to Build:

✅ Messaging screen (UI)
✅ When user sends a message:
Encrypt message
Upload to IPFS
Send CID on-chain
✅ Show sent messages in chat view
Tech:

Connect all previous modules
Add local caching (Hive)
Tests:

 Can I send a full message (end-to-end)?
 Can I receive and view messages securely?
✅ Stage 5: Reputation System Integration
Goal: Implement and test the reputation logic

What to Build:

✅ Smart contract function: updateReputation()
✅ Formula integration (your new simplified version)
✅ UI badge or rating for each user
Tests:

 Can I track reputation changes over time?
 Can I see how reputation affects trust labels?
✅ Stage 6: Polish, Testing, and Report Integration
Goal: Clean up, prepare screenshots for defense, polish app

What to Finalize:

✅ Add caching/optimization
✅ Add error messages, UX feedback
✅ Capture screenshots + code snippets for defense
✅ Generate sample logs for appendix/testing
